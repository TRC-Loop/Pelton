// Package crypto isolates Pelton's message signing and encryption behind a
// small, library-agnostic surface so the rest of the app never imports an
// openpgp or x509 package directly. PGP/MIME (RFC 3156) is implemented in full;
// S/MIME (RFC 8551) is currently a hard-failing stub, see smime.go for why.
//
// # The one safety rule that shapes this package
//
// If a caller asks for a message to be signed or encrypted and that operation
// cannot be completed for any reason (missing recipient key, missing or locked
// private key, library error), Wrap returns an error and a nil Part. It never
// returns a partial or plaintext result. The orchestration in internal/smtp
// only ever transmits bytes that came back from a successful Wrap, so a message
// that was meant to be encrypted can never leave as plaintext. The plaintext
// entity stays a local variable inside Wrap and is dropped on any error path.
