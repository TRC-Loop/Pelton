// passphrase.ts drives the prompt for a locked PGP private key (#192). The
// prompt is raised from wherever a locked key is needed (settings today,
// decryption and signing later), so the request goes through this store rather
// than each caller rendering its own copy of the dialog.
//
// The passphrase itself never lands in this store: the dialog hands it straight
// to the backend, which verifies it against the key and holds it for the
// session. Nothing here is persisted.
