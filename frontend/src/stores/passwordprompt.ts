// passwordprompt.ts drives the missing-password prompt (#266, #290). The prompt

// mailbox list, so the request goes through this store rather than each of them
// rendering its own copy of the dialog.
//
// It also holds which accounts have no stored password, since that is what the
// warning marker next to a mailbox reads.
