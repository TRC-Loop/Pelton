// tabs.ts owns the reading-pane tabs (#197): messages parked in the pane so you
// can go and look at something else without losing your place.
//
// The relationship with the plain reading pane is deliberately one-directional.
// Clicking or arrowing through the message list always lands in the untabbed
// pane, which is the first slot in the bar; a tab only ever changes when it is
// opened. That keeps the feature invisible to anyone who never opens one: with
// no tabs there is no bar and the pane behaves exactly as it did before.
//
// A tab holds a message id, not a snapshot, so flags and read state stay live
// and a message that moves folder is followed rather than broken. A message
// that is deleted leaves its tab behind marked stale, for you to close.
